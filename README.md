# vim-win-mac-compat

Consistent VS Code (Vim) bindings for Windows & Mac.

## Why?
If you switch between Windows & Mac frequently, and use Vim in VS Code (like me), these bindings are helpful.
Since Mac has 4 modifier keys and Windows has 3 - it is tricky to bring consistency. Using Windows as the baseline, I've created this key mapping.

**Enjoy!**
